# readings
The main purpose of this list is to keep track of the technical books or papers which I find worth reading. It can also serve as a reference for anyone switching to software developing or data science from a non-cs background.

## Languages and OO Design
* [Hilfinger's A Java Reference Book](http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa14/book1/java.pdf): a good reference book listed in Berkeley CS61B course readings.

* [Head First Java](http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-2nd-Edition/dp/0596009208): Illustrative, lots of pictures. Fun and easy to read. Good introductory book to java.

* [Head First Design Patterns](http://www.sws.bfh.ch/~amrhein/ADP/HeadFirstDesignPatterns.pdf): Head First series are relatively easy. One can quickly go through the 600~ pages and learn some general principals and patterns in OO Design.

## Statistics and Modeling
##### Conventional Statistics
* [Statistical Models: Theory and Practice](http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Models-Practice-David-Freedman/dp/0521743850): 

##### Time Series Modeling
* [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications - With R Examples](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781441978646): 

##### Algorithmic Modeling
* [An Introduction to Statistical Learning - with Applications in R](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461471370):

## Algorithms
* [Algorithm for Interviews](http://www.amazon.com/Algorithms-For-Interviews-Adnan-Aziz/dp/1453792996): The book has a collection of good coding problems. 

* [Lecture Notes for Graph Algorithms and Network Flows](http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~hochbaum/files/IEOR266-lecture-notes-F2015.pdf): Most discrete optimization problems can be formulated as network flow problems. Writen by Prof.Hochbaum, expert in Approximation Algorithm, the note discusses how a large class of different formulations are linked, and for intractable problems, strong approximability results can be obtained.
